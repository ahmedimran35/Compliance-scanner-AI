# Performance Improvements & Modernization

## Overview
This document outlines the performance improvements and modernization changes made to the ComplianceScanner AI login and signup pages.

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. Performance Issues
- **Heavy Animations**: Removed 20 floating particles and complex Framer Motion animations
- **Unused Imports**: Removed 100+ unused Lucide React icons

- **CSS Classes Added**:
  ```css
  .cl-formFieldInput {
    background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) !important;
    border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2) !important;
    color: white !important;
